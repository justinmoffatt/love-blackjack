### About
A clone of Blackjack using the LÖVE 2D framework. The goal was to produce a quick prototype and Android application. The LÖVE 2D framework uses Lua scripting to draw the graphic interface and thus holds the game logic as well. An iteration was explored using classic OOP objects for data structures, but it later changed to embrace a more procedural script paradigm.

### Use
Once the [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) framework is installed, run LÖVE2D on the src folder. ```love src```

Execute the ```.love``` bundle from the releases download if LÖVE2D is configured to do so on your computer.

Download the ```.apk``` from the releases page on to an Android device; assuming your device is configured to install thrid party applications.
